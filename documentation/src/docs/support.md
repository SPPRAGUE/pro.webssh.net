??? example "Deploy WebSSH in Your Organization"
    Looking to deploy WebSSH within your organization? 

    For seamless deployment, we recommend using [Apple Business Manager](https://business.apple.com/) or [Apple School Manager](https://school.apple.com/), which provide the most efficient way to manage and distribute WebSSH across your organization.

    To proceed, please contact me via [email](mailto:team@webssh.net) and include your **Organization ID** and **Organization Name**. I will provide you with a dedicated link to download WebSSH for your organization.

    For any additional inquiries, feel free to reach out.
