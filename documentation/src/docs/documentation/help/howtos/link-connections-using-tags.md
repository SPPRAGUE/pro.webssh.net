# Link Connections using Tags

!!! info "About WebSSH Tags"
    WebSSH Tags are one-word labels that can be used to link connections with objects like snippets or State Bar items.

## How to link a connection and an object?
A connection and an object are "linked" when they share one or more tags. So if you add a tag to an object, the same tag should be applied to a connection in order to link them and so to be able to use the object with your connection.

## How to add multiple tags?
You can use any of these separators in order to add multiple tags : `,;/-|` and `space`

!!! tip "Tips"
    * You can mix multiple separators on the same line, it doesn't matter.
    * Tags are always capitalized. It's "not possible" to add a lower case tag (or should be reported as bug).
    * By default a blank tag is applied so all objects are linked to all connections.
    * You can add as many tags you want to a connection or an object.
    * You can also use the wildcard char `*` to link an object to all connections.
