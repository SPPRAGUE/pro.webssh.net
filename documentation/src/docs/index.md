# Getting Started
## About WebSSH
WebSSH is an "awesome" iOS / macOS SSH, SFTP and Port Forwarding client since 2012!

## Installation
1. Launch the App Store on your iOS or macOS device
2. Search for "WebSSH - SysAdmin Tools"
3. Install it, it's [freemium](/documentation/pricing/)!

Alternately if you don't find it, use this link to the App Store : [download WebSSH](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webssh-ssh-client/id497714887)

!!! info "Beta Releases"
    Want to try the upcoming releases?

    [Enroll to Beta Releases](/documentation/becoming-external-tester/) and reach the stars :sparkles:

## What about the name?
The name sounds weird? Think twice! WebSSH is a NATIVE and LOCAL SysAdmin Toolbox with Privacy and Security in mind which ensure that no data will leave your device outside your own secure servers.

As everybody knows, the "SSH" part means Secure Shell. But what about the "Web" part?

Just because WebSSH terminal rendering engine is based on [Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/), a JS library running on your own device! :)

Have a nice day :sunny:
